# Vue Employee Table

This is a simple Vue js app in which a visitor can add a new employee, edit a current one or delete an employee. All changes made to the employees are local only and page will revert to it's original state on refresh. 


I'm using JSON Placeholder to fetch employee data and display them on the page, as well as Primitive UI for page styling.
